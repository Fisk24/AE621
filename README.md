# AE621
This is a queue based client for e621.net.
This app aims to allow the user to select all of the posts that they wish to view, and then flip through them all at once.

Viewing is supposed to feel "Endless"
At any time, swiping left on the post grid will immediatly take you to the last post you selected. From there you may continue
swiping left to proceed through the queue of posts that you selected.
At any time, while viewing a queued post, pressing the back button will immediatly take you back to the post grid.

The post grid scrolls endlessly loading more posts as needed. (No need to change pages)

The final goal is to have full feature parody with e621.net (including voteing, favoriting, and blacklisting)

Upcoming features:
- Pool Viewing
- Child and Parent post links
- Comments (Viewing and Posting) with dText
